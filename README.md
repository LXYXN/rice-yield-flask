# Rice Yield Prediction — Statistical Machine Learning Assignment 1

I developed this system by training a machine learning model on agricultural crop data and deploying it as a Flask web application. I tested the model locally, added form validation, and built an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the trained model.

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning workflow including:
- **Data preprocessing** — cleaning, imputing missing values, numeric/categorical handling.
- **Model Training (Random Forest Regressor)** — trained using rainfall, pesticide usage, average temperature, and other crop-related variables.
- **Deployment** — serving predictions through a REST + HTML interface powered by Flask.

## Features
- Accepts user inputs such as Area, Year, average_rain_fall_mm_per_year, pesticides_tonnes, and avg_temp.
- Returns a numerical predicted rice yield using the trained Random Forest model.
- Web-based UI with clean input handling and real-time displayed predictions.
- Includes exploratory data visualizations (histograms, boxplots, correlation matrix).
- Supports both HTML form submission and JSON-based API requests.

Deployed the project to Render (free tier) since it provides a straightforward zero-devops workflow for Python/Flask web services. The service automatically rebuilds and redeploys on every Git push to the main branch.

## How to run locally
1. Ensure Python (>=3.10) is installed.  
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
